# About Dashboard
This respository is to collect somes dashboard or pivot table during practice session, working session, and workshop based on my own interest. 

## 1. National Earth Science Education Research (IPST):
### Tool: Pivot Table [Link to Dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FgAV_tYMmgoWR2TQxMHfLp4xxnaZTz6CrKtFfy0qv-0/edit?usp=sharing)
I conducted a study on the difficulty of content in the national-level astronomy curriculum. This involved **conducting surveys in 2,500 schools across the country** to gather data from teachers who taught this subject. Subsequently, I conducted **focus group** discussions with a selected sample group to delvelop deeper into the causes of difficulty in teaching and learning.

After **collecting the data**, I proceeded to **clean** it due to repeated responses and incorrect data entries (such as school regions and sizes). Once the data cleansing was done, I **visualized** the data in a Google Sheets pivot table, presenting an overview of demographic statistics. I also **utilized the difficulty index equation** to rank the lesson content based on difficulty.

Further analysis involved **examining the relationship between the difficulty and external factors**, school size and region. I found that the most challenging content was "Module 6: The celestial spheres which is taught in advance science lesson of grade 12. The top three causes of difficulty were abstraction, complexity of content, and unfamiliar vocabulary, making it challenging for both teaching and learning. Additionally, the study revealed that smaller schools often attributed the difficulty to inadequate teacher knowledge and insufficient resources.

This comprehensive data offers valuable insights for the development of teaching materials that align with the needs of both teachers and students, contributing to future research.

## 2. Suicide Rate of Thai population
### Tool: Power BI [Link to Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/5cb4336c-0b41-4c6f-8d9d-78645f49fb9b?ctid=b5b7d4df-d750-4016-88da-e40c91edc27a&pbi_source=linkShare&bookmarkGuid=5af1ce95-d948-49d0-8b44-b8c38410c9c9)
  I studied the suicide rate of Thai people by collecting data from the Department of Mental Health's website and the Open Government Data portal (data.go.th). **I conducted an examination and data cleaning process**, during which I discovered inaccuracies in the data. These included errors such as the regional origin of the deceased, duplicate names, and missing information for certain locations in certain years. Consequently, I decided to **clean the data** and applied specific criteria to **remove incomplete entries**.

  Afterward, I imported the refined data into **Power BI** and **created a data model** using a star schema format. I then **visualized the data** with insightful dashboards, presenting the content related to the suicide rate among Thai people across three pages.

  The Dashboard began with the regional statistic of suicide rate in Thailand between 2012 - 2021, adn the number of mal and femal suicide population on each region. The second page continued on the insightful information of the highest and lowest suicide rate ranking by province. Lastly, I attached a factor, age, that might have related to the suicidal rate.

  **I already attached the dashboard in this repository (suicidal_dashbaord.zip)**. In case reviewing dashboard online, you can accese via the link above.
