## Suicide Rate of Thai population
I studied the suicide rate of Thai people by collecting data from the Department of Mental Health's website and the Open Government Data portal (data.go.th). I conducted an examination and data cleaning process, during which I discovered inaccuracies in the data. These included errors such as the regional origin of the deceased, duplicate names, and missing information for certain locations in certain years. Consequently, I decided to clean the data and applied specific criteria to remove incomplete entries.

Afterward, I imported the refined data into Power BI and created a data model using a star schema format. I then visualized the data with insightful dashboards, presenting the content related to the suicide rate among Thai people across three pages.

The Dashboard began with the regional statistic of suicide rate in Thailand between 2012 - 2021, adn the number of mal and femal suicide population on each region. The second page continued on the insightful information of the highest and lowest suicide rate ranking by province. Lastly, I attached a factor, age, that might have related to the suicidal rate.

I already attached the dashboard in this repository. In case reviewing online, you can accese via this link.
